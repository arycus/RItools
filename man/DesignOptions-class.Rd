\description{
Extends the DesignMatrix class
}
\details{
If the DesignOptions represents clusters of elements, as when it was created
by aggregating another DesignOptions or DesignMatrix object, then its Covariates
and NotMissing slots are populated with (weighted) averages, not totals.  E.g.,
NotMissing columns consist of weighted averages of element-wise non-missingness indicators
over clusters, with weights given by (the element-level precursor to) the UnitWeights
vector.  As otherwise, columns of the NotMissing matrix represent terms
from a model formula, rather than columns the terms may have expanded to.

\describe{
\item{\code{Z}}{Logical indicating treatment assignment}

\item{\code{StrataMatrices}}{This is a list of sparse matrices, each with n rows and s columns, with 1 if the unit is in that stratification}

\item{\code{StrataFrame}}{Factors indicating strata (not the sparse matrices, as we use them in the weighting function)}

\item{\code{Cluster}}{Factor indicating who's in the same cluster with who}

\item{\code{UnitWeights}}{vector of weights associated w/ rows of the DesignMatrix}
}}
