## Resubmission
This version no longer includes cran-comments.md. It is now listed in .Rbuildignore

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

Only error from lack of RSVGTipsDevice library on win-builder server.

## Downstream dependencies

We have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of RItools using `devtools::revdep_check()`
